            The college is issuing an official e-mail id to you. Kindly change
            your password on the first login by using the settings option. Keep
            a secure password of at least 8 characters having alphabets,
            numerical and special characters. It is the sole responsibility of
            the student that your e-mail id should not be misused, so never
            share your password with anyone. This e-mail id will be
            automatically deleted when you have completed your stipulated degree
            duration. So you must export the valuable data if any, before your
            final examinations of the course. You are also advised to adhere to
            the rules and regulations of the institute and further advisories
            issued from time to time. The college is not liable for any illegal
            and unconstitutional activity initiated from your e-mail id as this
            e-mail id is for academic purposes only. For any technical problem
            related to GNDEC Email-ID contact at: info@gndec.ac.in
